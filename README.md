# Tello_EDU
Just a repository to show how to use a tello 



# Notes

To set the proper IP for the Tello, go into tello.py and change "self.tello_ip = '192.168.10.1' " -> " self.tello_ip = '<InsertIpHere>' "
This will have to be checked everytime you reconnect the tello drone, in both the Tello Auto Flight and Tello Manual Control
